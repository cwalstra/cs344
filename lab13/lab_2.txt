Given:
A on B
B on C
T supports C
If X supports Y, Y on X.
If X on Y, X above Y
For X, Y, and Z, if X above Y and Y above Z, X above Z

Prove: A above T with Resolution

1. Assume the negation:
not A above T

2. Render the knowledge base in Conjunctive Normal Form

on(A, B)
on(B, C)
supports(T, C)
not supports(X, Y) or on(Y, X)
not on(X, Y) or above(X, Y)
not above(X, Y) or not above(Y, Z) or above(X, Z)


3. Unify
supports(T, C) and ( not supports(X, Y) or on(Y, X) ) --> instantiate X as T and Y as C -->
    supports(T, C) and ( not supports(T, C) or on(C, T) ) -->
    Since supports(T, C) is given, not supports(T, C) cannot be true, so on(C, T) must be true
    --> on(C, T)

on(A, B) and ( not on(X, Y) or above(X, Y) ) --> instantiate X as A and Y as B -->
    on(A, B) and ( not on(X, Y) or above(X, Y) )  -->
    Since on(A, B) given, not on(A, B) cannot be true, so, to make this statement true, the statement above(A, B) must be true.
    --> above(A, B)

    The same proof can be used with different variables to show that
    above(B, C)
    above(C, T)

above(B, C) and above(C, T) and ( not above(X, Y) or not above (Y, Z) or above (X, Z) ) --> instantiate X as B, Y as C,
    and Z as T --> above(B, C) and above(C, T) and ( not above(B, C) or not above (C, T) or above (B, T) ) -->
    Because above(B, C) and above (C, T) are given, not above(B, C) and not above(C, T) cannot be true.  To make the
    above statement true therefore, above(B, T) must be true.
    --> above(B, T)

above(A, B) and above(B, T) and ( not above(X, Y) or not above(Y, Z) or above (X, Z) ) --> instantiate X as A, Y as B,
    and Z as T --> above(A, B) and above(B, T) and ( not above(A, B) or not above (B, T) or above (A, T) ) -->
    Because above(A, B) and above (B, T) have been shown, not above(A, B) and not above(B, T) cannot be true.  To make the
    above statement true therefore, above(A, T) must be true.
    -->

not above(A, T) and above(A, T) cannot be true.  This is a contradiction, and thus this proof is concluded.
