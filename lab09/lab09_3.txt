a. Exercise 1
i.   The cats/dogs dataset contains 3,000 images, 1000 for training and 500 for testing.  They are taken from a dataset
     containing 25,000 images.
ii.  The neural network used in this problem uses three layers of convolution, like the network used in class, but it
     uses one more layer of maxpooling (3 vs 2), takes a 150x150x3 input as opposed to a 28x28x1 input, and fewer nodes
     in the convolution layers (16, 32, and 64 versus 32, 64 and 64).
iii. The images are consistently smaller and less detailed, keeping only the major features, and distinguishing the
     images.

b. Exercise 2
i. Data augmentation is the practice of applying random transformations to images so that the model will not learn from
the exact same image twice.  "This prevents overfitting and helps the model generalize better."

ii.
For all runs, 30 epochs and 50 validation steps were used.  The only hyperparameter changed was steps_per_epoch (s/e).

Accuracy for each run
s/e = 100: 0.743
s/e = 120: 0.8010
s/e = 150: 0.7780

Increasing the steps per epoch too much likely caused some overfitting, which explains the accuracy decline between the
s/e of 120 and 150.
