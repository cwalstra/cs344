2.1
a. Both the Hill-climbing and simulated solutions successfully return the global maximum.
b. The difference in the time which each algorithm needs is minimal.
c. The starting value for x makes no difference because there is only one maximum in the function.
d. Changes in the delta value decrease the quality of the solution for both algorithms.  At very high delta values,
   (delta = 100), the two algorithms return the initial value.  At numbers close to the default value of 1 (single digit
   integers), the algorithms return values close to the actual answer of 15; however, because the step size in x is
   greater than 1, the result ends up getting shifted from the true answer of x=15 by a step or two because the y*delta
   + initial x may not equal x for a whole number value of y.  In this case, the algorithms step right over 15.  At very
   low values of delta (delta = 0.001), the hill-climbing algorithm returns the correct answer, but the simulated
   annealing algorithm returns something close to the initial value, likely because it cannot move enough to counteract
   a negative move.
e. The exp_schedule() controls the likelihood of the simulated annealing process taking a step in a negative direction.
   Because its output decreases as x increases, the likelihood of a random step back decreases as the search process
   continues

2.2
a. Both algorithms do significantly worse on this problem space than on the absolute value problem space.  The
   hill-climbing algorithm usually returns a local maximum close to the initial point, but only rarely returns the
   global maximum of 30 at x=30.  This occurs because the hill-climbing algorithm looks for higher and higher maximums
   until it cannot find a higher peak, at which point it stops and will not go down.  Therefore, the hill-climbing
   algorithm can only find a local maximum close to the initial point.   The simulated annealing solution, on the other
   hand, tends to generate random answers.  On one run, it might turn up the proper answer; on the next, it might turn
   up some answer with a negative value for x.  This schizophrenic behavior occurs because, while the simulated
   annealing algorithm usually moves toward the goal, it sometimes jumps to a less-optimal solution in the hopes of
   finding a better overall answer.  This accounts for the inconsistency and randomness in the results from the
   simulated annealing algorithm.  Neither algorithm stands out for their efficacy.
b. The starting value makes a large difference, as it controls how close the hill-climbing algorithm and, to a lesser
   extent, the simulated annealing algorithm come to returning the true global maximum, for reasons outlined in 2.2.a.
c. Changing the step size does little to change how the algorithms operate; it only changes how far afield they go in
   looking for the highest point.  The higher the delta value is, the further away the algorithms look.
d. Theoretically, the maximum possible value that can be returned is 30, but, unless implemented, there are no limits
   to how far afield the algorithms can go to find a peak, so the maximum possible value is 0.  The theoretical minimum
   possible value is the peak at x=2.03, with a value of 1.82.  However, because the simulated annealing algorithm can
   return values less than the max that it found, it is technically possible for that algorithm to return a value less
   than this number, although such a number would not go less than 0.
