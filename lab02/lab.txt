a. Both the Hill-climbing and simulated solutions successfully return the global maximum.
b. The difference in the time which each algorithm needs is minimal.
c. The starting value for x makes no difference because there is only one maximum in the function.
d. Changes in the delta value decrease the quality of the solution for both algorithms.  At very high delta values,
   (delta = 100), the two algorithms return the initial value.  At numbers close to the default value of 1 (single digit
   integers), the algorithms return values close to the actual answer of 15; however, because the step size in x is
   greater than 1, the result ends up getting shifted from the true answer of x=15 by a step or two because the y*delta
   + initial x may not equal x for a whole number value of y.  In this case, the algorithms step right over 15.  At very
   low values of delta (delta = 0.001), the hill-climbing algorithm returns the correct answer, but the simulated
   annealing algorithm returns something close to the initial value, likely because it cannot move enough to counteract
   a negative move.
e. The exp_schedule() controls the likelihood of the simulated annealing process taking a step in a negative direction.
   Because its output decreases as x increases, the likelihood of a random step back decreases as the search process
   continues
