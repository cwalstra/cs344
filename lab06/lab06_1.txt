1. We would like the machine learning model to classify books by genre to recommend them to people.

2. Ideally, the machine learning model should sort determine the genre of any book.

3. A successful program will be able to recommend a book in the correct genre at least 95% of the time.
   The key result for the success metric will be whether it recommends a book in the correct genre.
   It will be a failure if it consistently (>5%) recommends books in the wrong genre or fails to assign one.

4. The model will output the name of the book and its genre as strings.

5. The output must be obtained within 5 seconds of the user asking for it, and it will be used to recommend other books.

6. If we did not use machine learning, we would use a rule-based approach, e.g. all Tom Clancy books are thrillers,
   a subject of magic would correspond to fantasy, a subject of World War II fighter planes would result in a genre
   of non-fiction, etc.

7a. Our problem is best framed as a multi-class single-label classification which predicts a single genre for each book.

7b. Is the book fiction or non-fiction?
