Lab 10 Part 1:
a. I would rather use Keras than TensorFlow because Keras uses a much simpler user interface than TensorFlow does.

b.
The hyperparameters that I used were
learning rate: 0.005
steps=1000
batch_size=100
hidden_units=[10, 10]

I got an RMSE of 109.34 on the training data and an RMSE of 110.56 on the validation data.

For the final task, I got an RMSE of 107.99.
