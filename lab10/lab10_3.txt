# Lab 10 Part 3

a.
The confusion matrix showed that the model did very well.  The numbers most frequently misidentified were 2 and 5,
and the most frequently swapped pairs were 4 and 9 as well as 3 and 5.

b.
The NN used in the lab has a pair of 100 node convolutional layers, while the Keras example in class had a 32 node
layer and a 64 node layer.

Changing the batch size to 100 increased the validation set accuracy to 0.96 but does not improve the test set accuracy.
Increasing the learning rate to 0.1 has no effect on the accuracy of either the validation or the test set.

c.
Decreasing the number of steps from 1000 to 10 makes the images much less distinct and increases the frequency of images
which appear like checkerboards.
