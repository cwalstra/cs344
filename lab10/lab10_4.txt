a.
A linear model can be preferable to a deep neural network model, since they require less data and can perform as well or
better.

b.
The neural network and the linear regression model perform almost evenly.  The neural network has less loss, higher
recall, and higher precision.  The linear regression model has better accuracy.  On the whole, the neural network
performs slightly better, but either could be considered to be better, depending on what one prioritizes.

c.
Using embeddings has a small positive effects when doing sentiment analysis.  Adding the embeddings improves the
accuracy by 2.1 percent and the precision by 1.2 percent but decreases the recall by 2.2 percent.

d.
Film and movie have very similar embeddings, which makes sense because the two words are essentially synonymous.
