**Car Identification Convolutional Neural Network**

This project implements a number of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that identify a car's model from a picture of the car.  

The modules of code for this project:\
Imports\
Evaluation and Model Handling functions\
Network functions\
Operational Functions\
Start Functions

To run the code:
1. Download the tarball of all images from https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html
2. Untar the images
3. Change the file paths to match the paths that you used.
4. Run the script with the process_data argument as true
5. Delete most of the folders, leaving only the following cars
    1. 
6. Experiment

Code for this work was drawn from: https://github.com/michalgdak/car-recognition
