Part 2

A. The FTRL decreases the learning rate by a specified function every period controlled by the learning rate power.  It
tries different learning rates each period, trying to find the best value.  The FTRL rate is folded into the linear
regressor, which is returned, so it can be accessed by other runs.

B. Bucketing/binning enables comparisons between different levels of feature values to determine how changing the feature
impacts the output.
