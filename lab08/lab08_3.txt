A.
Seaborn works with MatPlotLib by simplifying some difficult tasks in MatPlotLib and also giving MatPlotLib more plotting
options.  Both are graphing modules, but Seaborn builds on top of what MatPlotLib can do.

B.
The dataset includes 397 values of which 314 provide all the data.  This seems a bit small for the millions of cars that
are on the road, but would make more sense if each correlated to a specific model, e.g Toyota Camry.

C.
Prescribed normalization sets the range of each data feature to a specified range based on the mean and standard
deviation.  This simplifies training the model because all of the features live on the same range.  This transformation,
with the same mean and standard deviation, also needs to be applied to the test and validation datasets, and any dataset
used with the model in the future.

D.
This is an example of a linear regression model because it tries to fit the data to a linear model.

E.
Smaller datasets do work better with smaller networks because, if a network is too large in relation to the testing
data, the model will be overfit to the testing data, which reduces the ability of the model to make predictions outside
of the testing data set.
