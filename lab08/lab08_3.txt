Lab 8.3

A.
Seaborn works with MatPlotLib by simplifying some difficult tasks in MatPlotLib and also giving MatPlotLib more plotting
options.  Both are graphing modules, but Seaborn builds on top of what MatPlotLib can do.

B.
The dataset includes 397 values.  This seems a bit small for the millions of cars that are on the road, but would make
more sense if each correlated to a specific model, e.g Toyota Camry.

C.
Prescribed normalization sets the range of each data feature to a specified range based on the mean and standard
deviation.  This simplifies training the model because all of the features live on the same range.  This transformation,
with the same mean and standard deviation, also needs to be applied to the test and validation datasets, and any dataset
used with the model in the future.
