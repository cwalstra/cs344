A. The Pearson correlation coefficient measures how closely related two sets of data are, assuming that the relationships
between the datasets are linear.  For example, the relationship between population and total number of bedrooms has a
correlation coefficient of 0.9.  This makes sense because, in general, more people are going to need more bedrooms,
although the correlation is not perfect because people can share rooms.  On the other hand, the relationship between
rooms per person and housing median age shows a correlation coefficient of -0.1, which makes sense because the rooms per
person and the housing median age will not likely have a linear relationship.

B.
Exercise 1:
For exercise 1, I tried using both median income and median income with rooms per person.  Median income alone produced
a RMSE of 227, while median income with rooms per person generated an RMSE of 226.  Neither beat Google's example data,
which used the features latitude and median income and produced an RMSE of 113.

Exercise 2:
The synthetic feature that I used was is_LA_or_SF, which returned 1.0 if the latitude was between 33 and 34.5 or equal to
37 or 38 and 0.0 otherwise.  This produced an RMSE, when used with median income, of 138.85, while Google's example,
which used buckets for each degree of latitude, produced an RSME of 140.20.
