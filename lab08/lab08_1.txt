A. The Pearson correlation coefficient measures how closely related two sets of data are, assuming that the relationships
between the datasets are linear.  For example, the relationship between population and total number of bedrooms has a
correlation coefficient of 0.9.  This makes sense because, in general, more people are going to need more bedrooms,
although the correlation is not perfect because people can share rooms.  On the other hand, the relationship between
rooms per person and housing median age shows a correlation coefficient of -0.1, which makes sense because the rooms per
person and the housing median age will not likely have a linear relationship.
