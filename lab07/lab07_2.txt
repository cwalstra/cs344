# Exercise 1
Hyperparameters
learning_rate: 0.0001
steps: 100
batch_size: 1

RMSE: 166.39


# Exercise 2
I was unable to do better with input_feature set to population instead of total_rooms.
The best I was able to do was 177.59.
Hyperparameters
learning_rate: 0.0001
steps: 300

RMSE: 177


7.2.c
The hyperparameters learned in these exercises are the x and y extents and the weight
and bias.  There is no standard tuning algorithm for tuning these parameters.
